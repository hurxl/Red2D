## Installation

1. Download [Red2D.zip](https://github.com/hurxl/Red2D/releases/latest) and unzip the file.
2. Put the Red2D folder in /Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro User Files/Igor Procedures.
3. Restart Igor Pro.


## Description

Red2D is a small data reduction package to convert 2D elastic scattering patterns to 1D I-q profile, working on a scientific data analysis software [Igor Pro](https://www.wavemetrics.com/). This package handles data reduction for small/wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and static light scattering (SLS). This package is easy to install (See [Installation](#Installation)) and contains basic reduction features, suitable for light users. For more comprehensive data reduction and analysis, I recommend to use [Irena/Nika/Indra](https://github.com/jilavsky/SAXS_IgorCode) developded by Dr. Jan Ilavsky.

This package can
- Load 2D scattering patterns (32bit signed integer tiff)
- Display 2D images and 1D I-q or I-2Î¸ profiles
- Get beam center and SDD by fitting standard samples (AgBh, Si, CeO2)
- Make and apply masks on images
- Perform circular average or sector average with solid angle correction.
- Normalize 1D I-q profiles with exposure time, transmittance, sample thickness, absolute intensity correction, and also support cell and solvent subtraction.


## Other features

- Batch reduction of multiple images
- Support tilted detector
- Fit standard samples even when beam center is outside the image
- ROI mask and sector mask avilable
- Azimuthal angle vs q profiles
- Combining multiple images into one image


## Requirement

- Igor Pro 8.0 or later by Wavemetrics
- This package has been tested on MacOS and Windows.
- This package does not support Igor 7 or older.


## Usage

- Please refer to the manual, included in the Red2D.zip, for step by step introcution.

Thank you Dr. S. Nakagawa to help me add the tilted detector correction and check the validity of reduced 1D profiles.
