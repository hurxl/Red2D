## Installation

1. Download [Red2D.zip](https://github.com/hurxl/Red2D/releases/latest) and unzip the file.
2. Put the Red2D folder in /Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro User Files/Igor Procedures.
3. Restart Igor Pro.


## Description

Red2D is a small data reduction package to convert 2D elastic scattering patterns to 1D I-q profile, working on a scientific data analysis software [Igor Pro](https://www.wavemetrics.com/). This package handles data reduction for small/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and static light scattering (SLS). This package is easy to install (See [Installation](#Installation)) and contains basic reduction features, suitable for light users. For more comprehensive data reduction and analysis, I recommend using [Irena/Nika/Indra](https://github.com/jilavsky/SAXS_IgorCode) developed by Dr. Jan Ilavsky.

## Main features

- Load 2D scattering patterns (32bit signed integer tiff, EDF, HDF5, text images)
- Display 2D images and 1D I-q or I-2Î¸ profiles
- Get beam center and SDD by fitting standard samples (AgBh, Si, CeO2, Chicken Tendon)
- Make and apply masks on images
- Perform circular average or sector average with solid angle correction.
- Normalize 1D I-q profiles with exposure time, transmittance, sample thickness, absolute intensity correction, and support cell and solvent subtraction.


## Other features

- Batch reduction of multiple images
- Support tilted detector
- Fit standard samples even when the beam center is outside the image
- ROI mask and sector mask are available
- Azimuthal angle vs q profiles
- Combining multiple images into one image


## Requirement

- Igor Pro 9.1 or later (Igor Pro 9.0 contains a bug that prevents this package from working correctly.)
- This package has been tested on macOS and Windows.
- This package does not support Igor 8 or older.


## Usage

- Please refer to the manual, included in the Red2D.zip, for a step-by-step introduction.
