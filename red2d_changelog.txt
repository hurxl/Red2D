Change log 2.4.1
# New features

# Change log 2.3.3
# Improvements
- Minor change on the circular average scheme

#Bug fix
- When selecting images on CircularAverage panel, the X-axis will not move to opposite side now.

# Change log 2.3.2
## Improvement
- A function to make masked images is restored.

## Bug fix
- A workaround added in Mask.ipf, GetMask_list(), to prevent a bug in Igor Pro 9.0. In Igor Pro 9.0, when adopting an empty wave to another empty wave, out of range error happens.
- Reversed mask option is reenabled.

# Change log 2.3.1
## Improvements
- User can select different masks for each image when performing a circular average.
- The auto process is modified to accept the new mask scheme.
- The auto process prompts an alert on start if the user did not perform a standard sample fit.

## Bug fix
- Images displaying function now works correctly in the circular average panel.
- Mask panel and circular average panel now can open even if no Red2Dpackage datafolder exists.

# Change log 2.3.0
## Improvements
- ShowHideTraces was largely improved.
- Simple Circular Average function was added in Others.
- Mask functions were largly improved.

## Known Issues
- ShowHideTraces may work unstably because a known bug in Igor Pro 9. Using the Nightly Builds will solve this issue.

# Change log 2.2.8
## Bug fix
- Sensitivity correction now considers the difference of solid angle between pixels.
- Making mask now does not overwrite the original images.
- Autoprocess now does not generate error messages when no new 1D profiles were reduced.

# Change log 2.2.7
## Bug fix
- Sensitivity correction menu is now active.

# Change log 2.2.6
## New feature
- Load text images (asc, txt, dat).
- Load binary images of SANS-U, ISSP, U-Tokyo.
- Automatically load header from images as wave notes.
- Correction for the detector sensitivity (experimental).

## Improvements
- Enable to mask region outside a ROI (reversed mask).
- Now you can add a new ROI mask to an existing ROI mask.
- You can display 2D images even in a 1D datafolder (if 2D images exist in the parent datafolder).
- SDD Combiner can combine 2 or 3 1D-profiles from different SDD.


# Change log 2.2.5

## Improvements
- Adapt for Windows screen resolution.


# Change log 2.2.4

## Improvements
- You can add the names of newly loaded images or 1D profiles to an existing datasheet. The data in the datasheet will NOT be deleted.
- You can load text images.

# Change log 2.2.3

## Improvements
- Add an option to auto mask images in the auto process

## Bug fix
- Fixed the issue that user cannot select root as the auto process datafolder.

# Change log 2.2.2

## New features
- Automatically load, reduce images from a selected folder.
- Automatically normalize 1D profiles by measurement time and transmittance from a selected datasheet path.
- Auto convert symbols, spaces and other unpreferable characters in image names to underscore when loading images. When image name starts with a number, a "X" will be appended in the beginning of the name.

## Improvements
- In the uncertainty estimation, add "1" in the standard error for zero-count pixels.
- When masking images, the masked images will be stored in the current datafolder and the original images will be stored in a sub datafolder.
- Change show/hide mask buttons from menu bar to the mask panels.


# Change log 2.1.2

## New features
- [show hide panel] Instantly show and hide all traces 
- [show hide panel] Filter traces on the Listbox with ImageName and SampleName
- [show hide panel] Reorder traces by ImageName and SampleName

## Improvements
- Display 1D now skips waves starting with "fit_" and "fitX_".
- Change show/hide mask buttons from DisplayImages panel to menu bar items for the masks
- Closing Image window without alert dialog

- [Code improvement] refreshing panels

## Bug fix

- When applying masks to all images, the image names were not properly printed in the command line.

# Change log 2.1.1

## Bug fix
- Export1D with SampleName used to exported ImageName.

## New features
- You can use Si, CeO2 as reference samples for SDD and beam center correction

## Improvements
- You can change ring width in Fit standard sample panel. By reducing the ring width, you can  get better peak detection result, but it may be a bit hard to locate the rings on the peaks.


# change log 2.1.0

## Notice
- [READ THIS] The new source codes in Red2D package are designed to deal with single float images. If you want to use this latest package to analyze an Igor file created by an old Red2D package before v.2.1.0, please use a command "Convert 32-bit integer to single float (-1 to NaN)" to properly convert your loaded images. This command is located in the menu "Red2D/Others". You need to do this for all datafolder containing 2D images. The newly loaded images will be automatically converted to single float and you do not have to run this command.

## New features
- Normalization functions (e.g. time and transmittance, cell subtraction) are now available for 2D images (located in others).
	- To enable correct 2D image normalization, 32bit signed integer tiff images are now automatically converted to signed single float when images are loaded.
	- Spaces between the detector panels are now auto-converted to NaN, previously noted as -1.
	- The command "Circular average" automatically skip NaN pixels.
	- The commands in "Mask" use NaN for masked pixels.

## Improvements
- Commands for datasheet is now placed in a separate menu.
- You can load and edit dataseheet in both 2D datafolder and 1D datafolder.

## Bug fix
- Export 1D now work properly when there is no datasheet or no SampleName column.
- AgBh ring positions now can be properly detected for single float images.


# change log 2.0.2

## Improvements
- Add images: You can auto delete images after add
Add images: Code was updated
Load Images: unacceptable characters such as " ", ".", "/" will be automatically converted to "_"
